These examples were created by Jeff Molofee '99 NeHe of http://nehe.gamedev.net

Converted to Haskell by Jason Dagit, 2005.  As far as I know, all
examples require GHC and the HOpenGL library.  I've tried not to add
anything else as a requirement.  This code is tested on OSX only.  If
you try it on another platform and it works for you, then please let
me know.

Usage:

make lessonXY            # this will build just lessonXY
make lessonXY.hs         # same as above rule, convienent for tab completion.
make                     # build everything
make clean               # gets rid of the .hs and .o files
make distclean           # make clean and get rid of the binaries

Acknowldegements:
I want to thank #haskell on irc.freenode.net for support and general
help.  Especially to Lemmih for supplying example code.
