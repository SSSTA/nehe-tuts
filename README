These examples were created by Jeff Molofee '99 NeHe of http://nehe.gamedev.net

Converted to Haskell by Jason Dagit, 2005.  As far as I know, all
examples require GHC and the HOpenGL and GLUT libraries. I've tried 
not to add anything else as a requirement (although look into the 
nehe-tuts.cabal file to make sure).  
This code is tested on OSX and MS Windows only.  If you try it on 
another platform and it works for you, then please let me know.

Usage of Makefile:

make lessonXY            # this will build just lessonXY
make lessonXY.hs         # same as above rule, convienent for tab completion.
make                     # build everything
make clean               # gets rid of the .hs and .o files
make distclean           # make clean and get rid of the binaries

Usage of Cabal package:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure
runhaskell Setup.hs build
# And here you are, all the executables ready to run.

If you are having problems with installing OpenGL bindings, or some weird linker
problems during compilation on MS Windows, please see this page:

Make sure to follow all the steps precisely; if something still fails, start from 
scratch: you've forgotten a step.


Acknowldegements:
I want to thank #haskell on irc.freenode.net for support and general
help.  Especially to Lemmih for supplying example code.
